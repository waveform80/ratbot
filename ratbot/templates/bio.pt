      <p>I finished my PhD in palaeobiochemistry in 2013 and now work as a
      technician. After getting into comics a few years ago, I decided to try
      drawing some of my own. The Major Mass Spec series was the first one I
      created and is based on the experiences of, and people in my research
      group.  The Ratbot comics logo was inspred by my pet rats, Jay and Silent
      Bob.</p>
