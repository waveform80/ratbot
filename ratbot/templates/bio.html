      <p>I'm a PhD student in the UK studing palaeobiochemistry. After getting
      into comics relatively recently I decided to try drawing some of my own.
      The Major Mass Spec series was the first one I did and is based on the
      experiences of, and people in my research group. The Ratbot Comics logo was
      inspired by my pet rats, Jay and Silent Bob.</p>
